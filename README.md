# SlothCord
Note: The master branch is fucntional (mostly) but the library is being rewritten. It is not recommended you use the rewrite branch as objects and references will be missing.

# Examples
Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/li223/SlothCord-Examples)

# How do use lib?
1) Download the library
2) Build it
3) Reference the correct dll for your project (either Netfx47 or NetCore2.0)
4) If it breaks, I blame you

# What if I have a burning question?
