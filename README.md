Note: The master branch is fucntional (mostly) but the library is being rewritten. It is not recommended you use the rewrite branch as objects and references will be missing.

# Branches
Master - This branch is broken to high hell
Rewrite - Currently rewriting the lib to not be as bad. Recommend you use this after I sort out Internal Ratelimiting

# How do use lib?
1) Download the library
2) Build it
3) Reference the correct dll for your project (either Netfx47 or NetCore2.0)
4) If it breaks, I blame you

# What if I have a burning question?
You can try to find me on Discord: li223#5153
