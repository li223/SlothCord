# SlothCord
Please don't use this lib. Use [DSharpPlus instead](https://www.github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus)

# If you really want to
Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/li223/SlothCord-Examples)

# How do use lib?
1) Download the library
2) Build it
3) Reference the correct dll for your project (either Netfx47 or NetCore2.0)
4) If it breaks, I blame you

# What if I have a burning question?
Then erm... IDK you could try find me on Discord: li223#5153 (Glhf with that)
